Obstacle_Avoidance_Multirotor
=============================
Codes are still under developement

Use Obstr_p_IR or Sonar files for indoor and outdoor operations.
Currently we will be using Propotional system for collision avidance.
PID is still under test.
I recommend using maxsonar for outdoor operations.
In NAZA or APM or PixHawk use with GPS attitude or position hold mode for best results in outdoor.
