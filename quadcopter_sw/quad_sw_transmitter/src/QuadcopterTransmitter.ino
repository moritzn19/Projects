/*The use of flightControls changes when the state of the quadcopter changes from armed
to disarmed as indicated by the state of boolean armed.

When disarmed, the transmitter sends the [[[[[[[[========[=====[[[[[[[[[[[=array [0,0,0,X] where X is the setting that corresponds
to either Naza GPS Mode, Naza Attitude Hold Mode, or Naza Manual Mode. These three modes are represented
by signals of 1855 microseconds, 1525 microseconds, and 1185 microseconds respectively. Switching between the modes
happens when the user presses the button corresponding to buttonPin.

When armed, the transmitter sends the array [T,A,R,E] where T is the throttle setting, A is the aileron setting,
R is the rudder setting, and E is the elevator setting. All of the settings are represented by signals between
1200 and 1800 microseconds.

The receiver is also programed to have armed and disarmed modes in which it listens for signals of the types described
above. To switch modes from armed to disarmed, the transmitter waits for the user to hold down the right stick button. When this happens,
bollean armed becomes true, and the transmitter sends the array [1220, 1220, 1220, 1220]. The receiver interprets this array as the
signal to arm itself, begin flight, and listen for arrays of the type [T,A,R,E].
